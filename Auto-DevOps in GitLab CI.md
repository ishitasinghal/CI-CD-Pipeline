# Day 18- Auto-DevOps in GitLab CI

To get started with Auto-Devops in GitLab CI, these are the following pre-requisites stated below. Therefore, first it requires study of these technologies first  before moving to auto-devops.

* Kubernetes - for basically orchestrating the things such as auto deployment, auto monitoring of the applications.
* Helm - it runs on top of Kubernetes, to manage packages for applications. 
* Docker - to create, run and deploy applications inside a container.
* GitLab Runner - for running different stages in the GitLab pipeline.
* Prometheus -  for event monitoring and alerting in case of any real-time problems in a database.

#### Kubernetes:

It is basically a tool used to orchestrate or manage containerized applications such as docker containerized application. Kubernetes clusters are made that helps to make the application highly available, scalable and easy deployments for frequent changes. Containers are bundled together including all the dependencies and libraries required, which helps run the application on any infrastructure.

In the following demonstration, a three nodes Kubernetes cluster will be spun up.
